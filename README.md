# hogstash

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/doismellburning/hogstash.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/doismellburning/hogstash)

Hogstash is a Haskell clone of [logstash](http://logstash.net/)

## Why?

I love logstash. I dislike Ruby. I like a good type system, pure functions, and immutability. I like Haskell. I want to learn more Haskell. Cloning logstash seemed a good practical project.
